## Artifactory Query Language
**Artifactory Query Language** (AQL) is specially designed to let you **uncover any data** related to the artifacts and builds stored within Artifactory. Its syntax offers a simple way to formulate complex queries that specify any number of search criteria, filters, sorting options, and output parameters. AQL is exposed as a RESTful API which uses data streaming to provide output data resulting in **extremely fast response times and low memory consumption**. AQL can only extract data that resides in your instance of Artifactory, so it runs on **Local Repositories, Remote Repositories** and **Virtual Repositories**.

- [Architecture](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/aql-architecture) 
- [Entities and Fields](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/aql-entities-and-fields)
    - You may issue a find request according to the syntax below, and configure your request to display fields from any of the domains.
- Syntax
    ```json
    <domain_query>
            .find(<criteria>)
            .include(<fields>)
            .sort(<order_and_fields>)
            .offset(<offset_records>)
            .limit(<num_records>)
  ```

<br/>
<br/>

| Terminology  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| domain_query  | The query corresponding to the primary [domain](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/aql-supported-domains). Must be one of items, builds or entries.  |
| criteria  | The search [criteria](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/search-criteria-construction) in valid JSON format  |
| fields  | (Optional) There is a default set of fields for query output. This parameter lets you [specify a different set of fields](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/specify-output-fields) that should be included in the output.  |
| order_and_fields  | (Optional) The fields on which the output should be [sorted](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/sorting-in-aql), and the sort order. A default set of fields and sort order is defined for each domain.  |
| num_records  | (Optional) The maximum [number of records](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-artifactory-documentation/display-limits-and-pagination) that should be extracted. If omitted, all records answering the query criteria will be extracted.  |
| offset  | (Optional) The offset from the first record from which to display results (i.e. how many results should be skipped for display)  |

## SEARCH FOR ARTIFACT MATCHING NAME PATTERN - AQL USING FILESPEC
- Run `jf rt s --spec=find-artifacts-match-naming-pattern-filespec.json`
    - Reference to [Filespec schema](https://jfrog.com/help/r/jfrog-cli/using-file-specs)

<br/>

## SEARCH FOR ARTIFACT MATCHING NAME PATTERN - AQL USING CURL
- Run
  ```text
  jf rt curl -XPOST /api/search/aql -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d @find-artifacts-match-naming-pattern-curl.json
  ```

<br/>

## SEARCH

<br/>
<br/>

## CHALLENGE - AQL [Optional]
- Find all the artifacts that has more than 5 downloads from repositories
    - HINT: We need to define scope for repositories with artifacts statistical downloads.
- Find 2 artifact which was build and published into repository created 7 days before, sort in descending order and sort by modified date.
    - HINT: we need **find** artifacts from **repository** with **matching name** **and** filter by **created**. Then **sort** artifacts based on **modified** in **descending**.
- Find all the artifacts from different repositories with same SHA256 value.
