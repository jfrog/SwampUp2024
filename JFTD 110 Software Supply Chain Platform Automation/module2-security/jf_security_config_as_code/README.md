## Getting Started

The content is broken down into the following sections to help with the flow.
```
├── 1_resource_indexing
├── 2_repo_config
├── 3_policies
└── 4_watches
```

Each folder consists of the following files
```
├── main.tf - Contains the main terraform resources to provision the resources
├── variables.tf - Contains variable declarations used in the main terraform file
├── sample.tfvars - Contains the values to pass into the variable file. By default all tfvars will be ignored by git.
├── outputs.tf - Contains information about config available on the command line
└── versions.tf - Contains required version information for terraform and providers
```

Ensure all the necessary tools are installed before you get started
```
jf -v
tf -v
```
if not installed then download or refer to the [executables folder](../executables/)
- [JFrog CLI version 2.67.0](https://jfrog.com/getcli/)
