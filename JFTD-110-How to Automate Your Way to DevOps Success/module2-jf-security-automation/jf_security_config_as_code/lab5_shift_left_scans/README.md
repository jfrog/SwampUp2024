### JF Curation Audit
JFrog Curation defends your software supply chain, enabling early blocking of malicious or risky open-source packages before they even enter. Seamlessly identify harmful, vulnerable, or risky packages, ensuring increased security, compliance, and developer productivity.

The 'curation-audit' is a JFrog CLI command designed for developers to scan their projects and identify third-party dependencies that violate the restrictions set by the Curation service.
