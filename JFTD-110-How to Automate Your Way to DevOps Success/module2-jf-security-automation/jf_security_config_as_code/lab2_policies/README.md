- [Operation Risk Policy as Code (xray_operational_risk_policy)](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/jfrog/xray/latest/docs/resources/security_policy)

### Prerequisites
Before proceeding please ensure the following labs are completed
- [lab1_resource_indexing](../lab1_resource_indexing/)
  
## Getting Started
Ensure you are in the right folder - `SwampUp2024/JFTD-110-How to Automate Your Way to DevOps Success/module2-jf-security-automation/jf_security_config_as_code/lab2_policies`

Purpose of the various terraform files used 

```
├── main.tf - Contains the main terraform resources to provision the resources
├── variables.tf - Contains variable declarations used in the main terraform file
├── sample.tfvars - Contains the values to pass into the variable file. By default all tfvars will be ignored by git.
├── outputs.tf - Contains information about config available on the command line
└── versions.tf - Contains required version information for terraform and providers
```

**Step 1 -** Create a copy of the `sample.tfvars` and add in your custom values. **NOTE** - all `.tfvars` files will be git ignored except `sample.tfvars`. Please do not modify sample.tfvars
```
cp sample.tfvars swampup.tfvars
```

**Step 2 -** Modify the `swampup.tfvars` file with relevant values. 
```
vi swampup.tfvars
